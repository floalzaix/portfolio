        <p>
          Hey there ! I'am Florian. Since I was ten back in 2014,
          I dedicated most of my
          time to making projects for myself. I learned Java to create
          extensions
          for the games I loved. Then, I learned HTML, CSS, and PHP to
          build my
          first websites (a bit childish and unprofessional at the time,
          of
          course). As I grew up, we had Python courses in high school,
          naturally I learned everything about it and made some small
          projects
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparatory class, I had the opportunity to study advanced
          algorithms
          in Python, which allowed me to understand the deeper layers
          that
          frameworks are based on. Finally, engineering school was
          where
          I first had the opportunity to make a living out of
          this
          passion. Now, I enjoy participating and creating fully
          functional and creative projects with new technologies such
          as AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have already made a few serious projects from scratch and
          collaborated with other developers from around the world, to
          make
          your visions come true. Feel free to check a few examples of
          projects
          below.
